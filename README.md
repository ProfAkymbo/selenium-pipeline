Using Test Logs Visualization with Graphs,
As a company, I run ~2 Million Selenium test Network logs a day on cloud. Build an ability to graphically visualize the logs using a low end resource cloud architecture framework. This code should be able to package and run on self-hosted machines or on cloud with proxy settings and public APIs for subscribed customers. 

## steps
To visualize the logs using graphs, you can use a variety of visualization tools such as Grafana, Kibana, or Tableau. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Collect and store the logs: You need to collect and store the Selenium test network logs in a database or file system that can be accessed by the visualization tool.

2. Choose a visualization tool: Choose a visualization tool that is suitable for your requirements and integrate it with your system. Grafana is a popular choice for visualizing time-series data, Kibana is suitable for log analysis, and Tableau is good for interactive dashboards.

3. Create data sources: Create data sources in the visualization tool to connect to the database or file system where the logs are stored.

4. Define queries: Define queries to extract the required data from the logs. You can use query languages such as SQL, Elasticsearch Query DSL, or Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) depending on the tool you choose.

5. Design graphs: Design the graphs that visualize the data. You can choose from a variety of graph types such as line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.

6. Package the code: Package the code that integrates the visualization tool and the data sources into a deployable format such as a Docker container or a package manager.

7.Configure for self-hosted machines or cloud: Configure the package to run on self-hosted machines or on cloud with proxy settings and public APIs for subscribed customers.

8. Test and deploy: Test the code and deploy it to the production environment.
9. Provide customer support: Provide customer support for subscribed customers and help them with any issues they may face in using the visualization tool.
